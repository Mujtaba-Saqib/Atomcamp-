1. Tool Choice: Power BI vs Streamlit

Power BI

Advantages:

User-friendly, executive-ready dashboards.

Automatic refresh from CSV folder (All Data).

Built-in DAX for YoY, YTD, indices.

Mobile app for CEO (Sumera), with clean visuals.

Disadvantages:

Pro license costs.

Limited custom analytics compared to coding.

Streamlit

Advantages:

Open source, flexible with Python.

Can integrate machine learning and advanced analytics.

Disadvantages:

Requires coding knowledge.

Not intuitive for non-technical executives.

Power BI is the best fit. Given the sales volume (45 stores × weekly POS data), Power BI handles the data easily, provides Sumera with a simple interface, and supports mobile layouts.



2. Weekly vs Yearly Comparisons

Weekly Comparison (Index):

Formula: Index = Current Week Sales ÷ Previous Year Same Week Sales × 100.

Example: Store 3, Dept 1 → if this year Week 20 = 55,000 and last year Week 20 = 50,000 → Index = 110 (growth).

YTD (Year to Date):

Running sum of sales from Week 1 up to current week.

Compared to last year’s YTD using the same weeks.

Example: YTD 2022 = 1.05M vs YTD 2021 = 1.00M → YTD Index = 105.



3. All Data Folder

Weekly POS exports (2011–2012) are combined into SalesFact.

Dimensions are added for:

DateTable (weeks, year, yearweek).

StoreDim (store name, manager).

DeptDim (department name).

Together, they form a Star Schema (see ERD).

This structure allows flexible slicing by date, store, department, and manager.


4. Big Picture Summary

Top 10 Stores / Departments → Ranked by weekly sales.

Bottom Performers → Identified through the same ranking (helps highlight struggling units).

Manager Commissions:

0.5% of sales for Top 5 stores (weekly).

Shown alongside YTD Commission to highlight long-term performance.



5. Dashboard Design

Big Numbers (Cards): Total Sales, Weekly Index, YTD Sales LY, Commission, Count of Stores.

Tables: Store + Manager + Sales + Commission, both Weekly and YTD.

Charts:

Top 5 Stores (bar).

Top Departments (donut).

Design Principles:

White theme (no dark background, no clutter).

Minimalist layout, optimized for mobile view.

Conditional formatting on indices (green growth, red decline).


6. Refreshing the Dashboard

Current Process:

Suleman extracts weekly CSV → place in All Data folder.

Analyst refreshes Power BI → updates in ~5 minutes.

Challenges:

Manual process is prone to delays and errors.

Will not scale if number of stores or years increases.

Recommendation to CEO:

Move from manual CSV refresh to an automated pipeline:

POS → Data Warehouse (SQL/Azure/BigQuery).

Power BI scheduled refresh daily/weekly.

Benefits:

Saves hours of analyst time.

Real-time dashboard access for Sumera.

Supports scale as company grows.
